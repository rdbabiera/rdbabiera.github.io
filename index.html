                <h3>Hello! My name is Rondavid (RD) Babiera</h3>
                <p>I am currently a third-year computer science student at the 
                  University of Chicago (Class of 2022). I originally came to 
                  UChicago to study Molecular Engineering, but after finding myself 
                  more passionate about programming and computer science combined with 
                  a lack of bio-oriented coursework in a still developing program, 
                  I decided that CS was for me and I never looked back since.
                </p><br>
                <h3>A list of languages I know in a convenient order of experience:</h3>
                <ut>
                  <li>C/C++</li>
                  <li>Python</li>
                  <li>Java</li>
                </ut><br>
                <h3>And a list of CS topics I'm interested in:</h3>
                <ut>
                  <li>Computer Architecture</li>
                  <li>AI/Machine Learning</li>
                </ut>
                <p>I expect this list to grow as I'm looking forward to learning new skills 
                  in order to have full mastery over both front and backend, in addition to 
                  the more hardware/firmware side of programming.
                </p>

                <p><b>Outside of the classroom,</b> I like to diversify what I do. 
                I'm a coffee and tea fanatic. I'm always looking for new ways to brew and drink 
                coffee - while I'm currently making cold brew in an immersion carafe, I hope 
                to work my way up to <a href="https://clivecoffee.com/products/yama-cold-brew-drip-tower" 
                target="_blank"> the cold brew tower</a>. 'Tea'-r list coming soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm a gamer by heart. The first game I've ever played was Pokemon Firered on the 
                  Gameboy Advance at the age of 5, and I definitely did not play the game properly, 
                  as I <i>only</i> used my Blastoise, and even at level 92 it couldn't tank a single 
                  Solarbeam from a level 62 Venusaur at the Elite4. Now, I'm organizing competitive 
                  League of Legends at school after playing competitively for a year, but I still 
                  play many different types of games ranging from Apex to Minecraft to Pokemon Go.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I played basketball and baseball up until the end of high school, but that's 
                  not stopping me from getting in pickup games (in a COVID-free world) at the gym 
                  or keeping my shot in form. You never know when somebody's going to need you to 
                  hit a three. My current go-to outside of team sports is just lifting at the gym 
                  when it's open or running trails/next to the bay back home.
                </p>
